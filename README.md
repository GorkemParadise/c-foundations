# C Foundations

This repository documents learning the C programming language from scratch.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in C by studying from multiple sources and writing code consistently. As the learning progresses, the focus will shift toward solving algorithms and developing small to medium-scale projects using C.

This repository is structured as a daily practice log and reflects continuous improvement.
